        <h1>Hi, I am Jessie, a Software Engineer</h1>
        <p>
          I am a senior at Chapman University majoring in Computer Science and
          minoring in Analytics. I plan to graduate in May 2022. I interned at
          CrowdStrike Summer 2021 where I assisted the Cloud Security Posture
          Management Team by implementing automated testing for account
          registration using Pytest, to decrease total time spent on manual
          testing in the future. Iâ€™m looking for a full-time position in
          full-stack development for Summer 2022.
